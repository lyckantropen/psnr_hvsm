# psnr_hvsm

Accelerated Python package for computing the PSNR-HVS-M image metric.

This is an implementation of the PSNR-HVS and PSNR-HVS-M metrics developed by
[Nikolay Ponomarenko](http://www.ponomarenko.info/psnrhvsm).

The values produced by this library fall within <0.1 dB precision when compared
to the values within the [TID2013
dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596514001490).
(See the folder [`tid2013_results`](tid2013_results).) The cause of the
discrepancy is not clear but the possible culprit is the internals of the
BT.601-5 conversion that is done within the Matlab function `rgb2ycbcr`. In
this library the color transform is not prescribed, but in the command-line
version the BT.601 for 8-bit digital RGB signals is used if the input is an
8-bit-per-component RGB image and the analog version is used otherwise.

## Installation

`psnr_hvsm` supports Python 3.6-3.9. Packages are distributed on PyPi. Be sure
to have an up-to-date pip to be able to install the correct packages on Linux:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

```bash
pip install psnr_hvsm
```

## Usage

### Command line

Command line support is an extra that pulls `opencv-python-headless`:

```bash
pip install psnr_hvsm[command_line]
```

```bash
python -m psnr_hvsm original.png distorted.png
```

### As a library

The function `psnr_hvs_hvsm` accepts images as single-channel floating-point
NumPy arrays. The images need to be normalised, i.e. the values need to be in
the range `[0,1]`. This can be achieved by converting the image to `float` and
dividing by the maximum value given the bit depth. For 8 bits per component
this is 255.

The images must be padded to a multiple of 8 in each dimension.

```python
import cv2
from psnr_hvsm import psnr_hvs_hvsm

image1 = cv2.imread('tests/baboon.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE).astype(float) / 255
image2 = cv2.imread('tests/baboon_msk.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE).astype(float) / 255

psnr_hvs, psnr_hvsm = psnr_hvs_hvsm(image1, image2)

print(psnr_hvs, psnr_hvsm)
```

```bash
34.427054505764424 51.64722121999962
```

If you need to measure PSNR-HVS and PSNR-HVS-M on an RGB image, you need to
convert it to an YUV colorspace and pass in only the luma component.

### Other exported functions

* `psnr_hvs` - returns only the PSNR-HVS value
* `psnr_hvsm` - returns only the PSNR-HVS-M value
* `hvs_mse_tile` - compute the weighted MSE of two 8x8 tiles
* `hvsm_mse_tile` - compute the weighted MSE with masking correction of two 8x8 tiles
* `hvs_mse` - compute HVS scores on all 8x8 tiles in the images, returns an array of numbers
* `hvsm_mse` - compute HVS-M scores on all 8x8 tiles in the images, returns an array of numbers

## Building

### Dependencies

`psnr_hvsm` has several dependencies:

* [FFTW3 >= 3.3.9](http://www.fftw.org/)
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
* [xtensor](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor)
* [xtensor-python](https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor-python)

All of the above can be automatically resolved by running `deps.ps1`, which is
a cross-platform PowerShell script (i.e. it can also be run under Linux if you
have PowerShell installed).

### Development mode

To install in development mode:

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
